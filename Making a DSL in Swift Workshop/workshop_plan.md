# Making a DSL in Swift - Workshop script

## Notes
- 2 hour session, so we may not get to both DSLs
- 2nd monitor to see everyone
- Break at about an hour (5 minute timer)
- Leave time at end for questions (~10m)

## Pre-workshop
- To send out in Slack channel
  + Please make sure you have the latest Xcode installed
  + Along the same lines, I would suggest restarting Xcode before we start (maybe your computer too)
  + To help cut down on background noise, I suggest everyone try and wear headphones. (Not a huge deal if you donâ€™t.)
  + Consider brining a snack : )
- Send out link to download materials
- General hello while waiting for everyone to join

## Warming up (15m)
- Ask for group to change name to what they want to be called and where they are calling from
- Ice breaker:
  + Name
  + What experience do they have with DSLs
  + What are they hoping for from this WWDC
- Pre-intro before getting started
  + Ask everyone to press the "yes" button to show progress
  + Let everyone know to ask questions & interrupt me at any point. The session should be interactive!
