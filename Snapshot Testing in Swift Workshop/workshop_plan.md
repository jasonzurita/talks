- What is snapshot testing
  + Different types of tests
  + Saving artifacts, regenerating them later, and comparing to make sure they have stayed the same
  + Not just for user interfaces (UI)
  + Checked into the code and show a nice history but also a great history of the changes in the app
  + Great for designers to get involved with PRs or any reviews because they can see the different combinations by inspection of the appâ€™s UI

- Why/when would we want to do it
  + Simple yet powerful
  + On the easier side to maintain
