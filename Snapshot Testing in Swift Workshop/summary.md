**Snapshot Testing**
Snapshot testing is the process of “freezing” an artifact (e.g., saving an image of your app’s screen), and then making sure it never changes in a test. These kind of tests can automatically catch many things like if a screen’s layout breaks by accidentally changing a constraint or from…say…an iOS update 😅.

Join this workshop to explore how to do snapshot testing for both user interfaces (UIs) and for objects (often left out when talking about this subject). Together we will explore the versatility of these kinds of tests, how much fun they can be to write, and how they help us ship app updates with confidence.

Please have the latest Xcode installed.
